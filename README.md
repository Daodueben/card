## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

What I learned during this project is how to use the flexbox wrap property. It helps to scale the design based on the user screen width. I also learnt how to add google font to my website.

```html
 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
 <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lexend+Deca&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```




### Continued development

In later development, i want to get comfortable to using the media query, for now i'm not too much comfortable with it.



### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for the media query section. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [resource 2](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me for the importing or adding of google font link to my website. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
